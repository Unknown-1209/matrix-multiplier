# matrix-multiplier
A repository for a matrix class that uses a matrix multiplication function to multiply two matrices together. There are two multiply functions. The first is a naive approach. The second approach implements the Coppersmith-Winograd's algorithm. This optimization aims to reduce the number of multiplications used in the matrix operation as a whole.
